          Opening March 2019, The Modal Cafe will be bring the tastes, smells, and sounds of the world of jazz to the neighborhood! Whether you are looking for coffee, live music, or free wifi, Modal Cafe is the place to be. We prepare our food's ingredients daily, and only work with farms and vendors who operate within a sustainable and fair-trade framework. Our main room will be filled with the sounds of local musicians (11am - 5pm, special sets after 7pm), and we host a weekly Open Mic Night (Wed. 6pm-9pm) for those who would like to play! The Modal Cafe is located in the suburbs of <em>Plano, Texas</em>.</p>
